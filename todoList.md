There's plenty to do. Beyond the obvious, here are some things to tidy up:
* Handle xref with unexpected content
* Handle xref to element with no title
* Handle whitespace only and empty link and ulink elements
* Handle duplicate ids in source docbook document.
* Markdown and HTML documents should be treated as articles, not as books.
* Generated HTML links should have a title attribute.
* Tidy-up output file naming scheme.
* Add some static analysis to the build.
* Log a warning when an Error element is added to the document.
