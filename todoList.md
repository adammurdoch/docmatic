There's plenty to do. Beyond the obvious, here are some things to tidy up:
* Handle xref to element on another html page
* Handle xref with unknown linkend
* Handle xref with no linkend defined
* Handle duplicate ids in source docbook document.
* A Markdown document should be treated as an article, not as a book.
* Generated HTML links should have a title attribute.
* Tidy-up output file naming scheme.
* Add some static analysis.
* Split out the model interfaces from the model implementations.
